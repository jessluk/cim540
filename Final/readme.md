# My Final Project Ideas


## IDEA #1

### Fish Tank

I want to have a fish tank with animated fish swimming in it. There will also be bubbles in the background constantly moving along with bubble noises. I will include hit points/interaction areas where if the fish reaches it or there is a click, the fish can change color or direction. There will be aspects where you can feed the fish. Also, I want the tank to over time fog up with algae and then you can click an aspect that lets you clean it. 
## IDEA #2

### DJ Turn-tables 

There will be 2 turntables and all the parts that are included. I want to be able to select from different songs to play and then control the tempo, speed, pitch, etc. I also want there to be a sound effects board. The records will spin when a song is selected and then stop. This will be controlled with 2 interface buttons.

## IDEA #3

### Football Game

This game will compose of a football field and goal post. The object of the game is to kick a field goal. The goal post will be moving from the left to right continuously and the player needs to press the space bar to kick the ball. There will be buttons to control the different levels. Easy = slow speed and bigger post, Medium = faster speed and medium post, Hard = extra fast speed and small post. I also want other challenges invoved such as wind direction.
